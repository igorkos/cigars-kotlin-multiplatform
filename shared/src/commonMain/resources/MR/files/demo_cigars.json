But it is the flavor that makes it a classic smoke. The Honduran and Nicaraguan tobaccos come together to create leather, chocolate and spice notes, and a long, lush finish. ",

Originally from Cuba, José Garcia, his son Jaime and daughter Janny now make millions of cigars at My Father, perhaps none finer than the La Aroma de Cuba Mi Amor Belicoso. They combine Nicaraguan tobacco they grow themselves—using two binder leaves, as is their custom—with this dark, Mexican wrapper, and the combination is sublime. The tidy Belicoso is a box-pressed smoke that burns beautifully and has a lovely woody component balanced by notes of sweet nougat and copious amounts of nuts on the palate. ",
